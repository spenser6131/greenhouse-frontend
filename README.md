# GreenHouse
This application gives plant-moms and -dads the ability to better provide their houseplants with optimal growing environments and more consistent watering/fertilization schedules. Users can create a virtual home of different rooms, each with a 1-5 rating of the room's light and humidity levels. The rooms are then filled with plants, each with their own light and humidity requirements, as well as a few other useful stats and metrics. Plant/Room suitability is reflected in the details of each plant, helping the user determine whether a plant should be relocated.
